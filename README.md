# Note-Taker

## Description
The goal of this assignment was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Key Points
1. User is presented with existing notes on the left hand side when they arrive at the notes page
2. When user clicks on existing note in the left hand column, the note then appears in the right-hand column
3. When the user clicks on the write icon on the top of the page, they're presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and note
4. When the user clicks the save icon, the new note that they entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column
5. When the user clicks the trash icon on the left hand column, the note is deleted
